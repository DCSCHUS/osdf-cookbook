    "EnviStor is an AI-assisted, modular data pipeline developed at Florida International University (FIU) to process and publish environmental datasets. It automates tasks like file type detection, metadata generation, geospatial transformations, and dataset publication. For this use case, EnviStor ingested buoy data, processed and cleaned it, and published it through the OSDF federation, making it available to science users via PelicanFS.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Salinity** is a measure of how much salt is dissolved in water. It’s typically measured in **Practical Salinity Units (PSU)**, which approximate parts per thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salinity is an essential parameter in understanding water quality, ocean circulation, and ecosystem dynamics. High salinity may indicate saltwater intrusion in coastal environments, which can affect drinking water sources and aquatic habitats.\n"
